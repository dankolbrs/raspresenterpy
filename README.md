Raspberry Presenter
===================


It is a lightweight system to present in raspberrypies
in kiosk mode.  The intent is to have a way to
display several jenkins outputs (or similar).

Written in python (it workins in 2.6 and above) and
python Qt (Qt4).

And using WebKit.

Thanks for Gustavo Noronha for challenge me to create
that.
